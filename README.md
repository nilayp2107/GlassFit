### Problem Definition:
The goal of this project is to develop a system that can automatically classify human faces into 5 different shape categories, such as round, oval, square, oblong or heart-shaped. The system will take as input a collection of facial images in .jpeg format, and use deep learning techniques to extract and analyze facial features, allowing it to accurately classify each image according to its corresponding face shape category. The project will involve building a CNN-based model to train and test the face shape classification system, as well as implementing various performance evaluation metrics to assess the effectiveness of the model. The final system will then recommend spectacles frame according to the face shape. For example, square frame looks good for round face shape.
